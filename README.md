### Issues

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.

Issues are very valuable to this project.

* Ideas are a valuable source of contributions others can make
* Problems show where this project is lacking
* With a question you show where contributors can improve the user experience


### Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:


#### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add a code for Arrays

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add a code for Arrays
> > Question: Sum of numbers in an array(taking input for user)

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.


#### Is it of good quality

* There are no spelling mistakes
* It reads well


#### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

* To provide a simple implementaions of codes with time complexites on the go, anyone can copy and paste, into their project
* The content is usable by someone who hasn't written something like this before
* Foster a culture of respect and gratitude in the open source community.
